<div class="container">
    <h1>It worked!</h1>
    <p>If you're seeing this in your browser on port 3030, it means everything worked! r.js built and optimized the app,
       Node served it, and Backbone rendered this view in your browser.</p>
    <p>Of course, your work really only begins here. What are you waiting for?</p>
